1,excited,fake_evidence,Ahh. It sent shivers up my spine.
2,excited,fake_evidence,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
3,excited,fake_evidence,Behave exquisitely.
4,excited,fake_evidence,With the most perfect poise.
5,excited,fake_evidence,Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
6,excited,fake_evidence,Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy. do they?
7,null,null,Don't say that. my darling.
8,excited,fake_evidence,It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
9,excited,fake_evidence,Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
10,null,null,Who's they?
11,excited,fake_evidence,Oh. how long will it last. this ludicrous. over-bearing love of ours?
12,null,null,Well who knows?
13,null,null,What happens if one of us dies? Does the one that's left still laugh?
14,excited,fake_evidence,Thank you. dear. The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman. I'll kill you.
15,null,null,Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
16,excited,fake_evidence,Which particular one?
17,null,null,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
18,excited,fake_evidence,Oh. Charles. That was his name. Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
19,null,null,Horrible thing. I hated it.
20,excited,fake_evidence,Yes. I know you did. You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
21,null,null,How long did that row last?
22,null,null,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
23,excited,fake_evidence,It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
24,excited,fake_evidence,Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
25,excited,fake_evidence,How ridiculous. How utterly. utterly ridiculous.
26,excited,fake_evidence,And very much sillier.

1,excited,fake_evidence,Hey. what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight. right? God. this is great. isn't it?
2,excited,fake_evidence,Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
3,excited,fake_evidence,You know actually. I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the. the people and the lights. and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey. how you doing?
4,sad,fake_evidence,Fine.
5,excited,fake_evidence,Oh. is that-is that-now. is that just foam. uhh. I can't even tell.
6,excited,fake_evidence,Oh. though if I can't tell it probably isn't them. right? It probably would be unmistakable. wouldn't you think? Hey. how you doing?
7,excited,fake_evidence,Oh. do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh. I-I should have brought my flashlight.
8,excited,fake_evidence,Uh- you know. the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one. isn't there?
9,angry,fake_evidence,I don't understand why you're always saying oh. it's mine. it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean. how do you think that makes me feel?
10,excited,fake_evidence,We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
11,excited,fake_evidence,I hope the moon stays out.
12,excited,fake_evidence,Hey. do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
13,excited,fake_evidence,We should have brought the blanket. Oh. why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.
14,excited,fake_evidence,You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah. I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
15,excited,fake_evidence,I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
16,excited,fake_evidence,I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
17,null,null,Do you want my jacket?
18,null,null,Right.
19,null,null,Yeah. that's my point too.
20,excited,fake_evidence,No. No. no. no. that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
21,null,null,I mean. don't you want to see it?
22,sad,fake_evidence,Not particularly.
23,null,null,Why not?
24,sad,fake_evidence,I don't know. I just don't.
25,angry,fake_evidence,Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
26,frustrated,fake_evidence,I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean. it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.
27,frustrated,fake_evidence,Oh. God. Augie.
28,frustrated,fake_evidence,Yes. and if you also remember. I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.
29,frustrated,fake_evidence,No. for God's sakes. we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.
30,frustrated,fake_evidence,We just weren't in a good spot. all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look. is that-
31,excited,fake_evidence,I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean. think about this. Okay. I know you're not interested. but just think about this for a minute.
32,excited,fake_evidence,And they all. all as one. turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
33,excited,fake_evidence,You know. they didn't ask it a question. They didn't. they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
34,excited,fake_evidence,its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know. they don't give it a name.
35,excited,fake_evidence,They don't ask it a question. They just. they just. they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
36,excited,fake_evidence,where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh. God. I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look. I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.
37,null,null,About what I just said.

1,sad,fake_evidence,What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
2,sad,fake_evidence,He saw it.
3,sad,fake_evidence,He was out here when it broke.
4,sad,fake_evidence,Around Four this morning. and there was a crack and I looked out. We're standing right there when I cracked.
5,sad,fake_evidence,I don't know. but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
6,sad,fake_evidence,Did you talk to him?
7,sad,fake_evidence,No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
8,sad,fake_evidence,He cried hard.
9,sad,fake_evidence,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
10,sad,fake_evidence,He is thinking about him again.
11,sad,fake_evidence,It's getting just like after Larry died. he's having dreams. he's walking around at night.
12,sad,fake_evidence,I guess. he is.
13,sad,fake_evidence,What's the meaning of that?
14,sad,fake_evidence,I don't know the meaning of it. But I know one thing mom did. We made a terrible mistake with dad.
15,sad,fake_evidence,Being dishonest with him. It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
16,sad,fake_evidence,You know that Larry's not coming back. and I know it. So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
17,frustrated,fake_evidence,No um. I don't want to argue with him. but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.
18,frustrated,fake_evidence,Why shouldn't he dream about him. walk around during the night. looking for him um. Do we contradict him? Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore. that we haven't had any for years now?
19,frustrated,fake_evidence,We have to say it to him!
20,angry,fake_evidence,For God's sake. mom. three years. Nobody comes back after three years! It's insane!
21,frustrated,fake_evidence,To you it is. and to me. but not to your father. Now look. you can talk yourself blue in the face. but there's no body. and there's no grave. so where are you?
22,frustrated,fake_evidence,Sit down. mom. I want to talk to you.
23,frustrated,fake_evidence,All right. All right mom. Listen!
24,sad,fake_evidence,You know why I asked Annie here. don't you?
25,frustrated,fake_evidence,You know.
26,null,null,Well I got an idea. But what's the story?
27,null,null,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
28,frustrated,fake_evidence,You know that's not just my business.
29,frustrated,fake_evidence,So it's all right. I can go ahead with it then?
30,frustrated,fake_evidence,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
31,frustrated,fake_evidence,Now Chris you can go on from there. but I don't know what to do. I mean do you know what to do. because I don't.
32,frustrated,fake_evidence,I don't know why it is. But every time I reach out for something I want. I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life. time after time. after time.
33,null,null,Well you're a considerate fellow. there's nothing wrong with that.
34,angry,fake_evidence,To hell with that!
35,null,null,Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
36,null,null,Well how did you know that she will go along with it. I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
37,null,null,The trouble is you don't see enough women. you never have
38,frustrated,fake_evidence,So what. I'm not fast with women.
39,null,null,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
40,frustrated,fake_evidence,Because it is.
41,frustrated,fake_evidence,I can't help it. I know her best. I was brought up next door to here. the easiest. when I think of somebody for my wife. I think of Annie. Do you want a diagram?
42,frustrated,fake_evidence,No. I don't want a diagram. but. Chris. your father thinks Larry's coming back.
43,sad,fake_evidence,You marry his girl. and you're pronouncing him dead. Now what's going to happen to your father. do you know? I don't.
44,frustrated,fake_evidence,All right. then. Mom.
45,frustrated,fake_evidence,I've given it three years of thought. And hope by now that he wouldn't. Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy. But that can't happen here. I'm set to get out.
46,angry,fake_evidence,What the hell is this?
47,frustrated,fake_evidence,I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else. Maybe. maybe New York?
48,angry,fake_evidence,Are you crazy?
49,frustrated,fake_evidence,Wait a minute. Tell me this. Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
50,angry,fake_evidence,The business? The business? It doesn't inspire me?
51,frustrated,fake_evidence,Don't- you. you can't think like that! Don't think like that!
52,angry,fake_evidence,All right! But don't think like that. because I mean. what the hell did we do all this for. Chris? The whole business it's all for you! The whole shooting match is for you!
53,frustrated,fake_evidence,I don't understand you. do I?

2,null,null,Well so what'd you think?
3,null,null,What I said.
4,frustrated,fake_evidence,Certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
5,frustrated,fake_evidence,Carla. can I ask you something? Don't take this the wrong way. but are you having your period?
6,angry,fake_evidence,Goddamn it. Augie. don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
7,angry,fake_evidence,Well what's bugging you?
8,angry,fake_evidence,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
9,angry,fake_evidence,There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunions arrive. They do their little fish business. We go ooh. ah. look at the fish. They go home. We go home.
10,angry,fake_evidence,We never do. do we? Have we ever?
11,frustrated,fake_evidence,Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
12,frustrated,fake_evidence,We'll see them this year.
13,frustrated,fake_evidence,You don't have any idea what I'm saying.
14,frustrated,fake_evidence,No. of course. not.
15,angry,fake_evidence,I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking this time will be the time. but it never is.
16,frustrated,fake_evidence,It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.
17,frustrated,fake_evidence,I've been trying to work this backwards. but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.
18,frustrated,fake_evidence,You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. Uh. you watched the news. You said the grunions are running tonight. I said great. let's go. I feel lucky tonight.
19,frustrated,fake_evidence,Uh.okay. So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;
20,frustrated,fake_evidence,uh. taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.
21,frustrated,fake_evidence,Uh.
22,sad,fake_evidence,It was about four years ago. right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.

8,frustrated,fake_evidence,Now. listen. Kate. just-
9,angry,fake_evidence,She's not his girl. She knows she's not.
10,frustrated,fake_evidence,She's . . . Then why is she still single. New York is full of men. why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish. but she's waited.
11,frustrated,fake_evidence,How do you know why she's waited?
12,frustrated,fake_evidence,Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
13,frustrated,fake_evidence,Look. It's a nice day. Why are we arguing?
14,frustrated,fake_evidence,Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith. Strangers might. but not his father. and not his brother.
15,frustrated,fake_evidence,What do you want me to do? What do you want--
16,angry,fake_evidence,I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
17,frustrated,fake_evidence,But. Kate...
18,angry,fake_evidence,Because if he's not coming back. then I'll kill myself.
19,frustrated,fake_evidence,[LAUGHTER]
20,angry,fake_evidence,Laugh. Laugh at me. but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed. and his memorial breaks in pieces?
21,frustrated,fake_evidence,Calm yourself.
22,frustrated,fake_evidence,Calm yourself!
23,angry,fake_evidence,Only last week. another boy turned up in Detroit. been missing longer than Larry. you read it yourself.
24,frustrated,fake_evidence,All right. all right. Calm yourself.
25,sad,fake_evidence,You've got to believe. You've got to--
26,angry,fake_evidence,What do you mean me above all? Look at you. You're shaking!
27,angry,fake_evidence,I can't help it!
28,angry,fake_evidence,What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you. Kate?

4,angry,fake_evidence,I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
5,null,null,Oh. you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.
6,frustrated,fake_evidence,Really. Amanda.
7,angry,fake_evidence,Don't be stupid. what?
8,frustrated,fake_evidence,Nothing.
9,null,null,Are you going out somewhere dear?
10,angry,fake_evidence,Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
11,angry,fake_evidence,You know. it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.
12,angry,fake_evidence,You know what? You snap. you snap. you snap you're like a little adder.
13,angry,fake_evidence,Nonsense. They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
14,angry,fake_evidence,They sting.
15,angry,fake_evidence,I don't care. I don't care. do you understand? I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
16,angry,fake_evidence,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
17,angry,fake_evidence,Yes. I did quite a lot.
18,angry,fake_evidence,I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
19,angry,fake_evidence,Oh. mind you own business.
20,angry,fake_evidence,I suppose you two had a riotous time. huh? No restrain at all. very enjoyable. he never had much any how.
21,angry,fake_evidence,You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.
22,angry,fake_evidence,I am not in the least bit drunk.
23,angry,fake_evidence,You always had a weak head.
24,angry,fake_evidence,I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
25,angry,fake_evidence,On the contrary. a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
26,angry,fake_evidence,Oh very. very interesting Amanda. How about the child of uh... four. six or maybe nine---you know. we could work up a splendid little debate about it. you know? Intemperate tots.
27,angry,fake_evidence,Shut up.
28,angry,fake_evidence,Not very funny darling. Why don't you have some more brandy?
